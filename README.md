## Project Overview
This project is based on the research paper "**Enhancing Brain Analysis Insights: Deep Graph Learning for Cognitive Brain Connectivity Based on EEG with Interpretable EBNCRN Model**" and aims to explore the critical role of cognitive tasks in cognitive state analysis. It proposes an innovative deep learning model, the **EEG-Brain-Network Cognitive Recognition Network** (EBNCRN), to identify cognitive tasks and conduct in-depth analyses.

Cognitive impairment has become a significant mental health issue in modern society. Addressing the current lack of effective treatments for severe cognitive impairment, this study focuses on prevention and intervention as its core objectives. By integrating cognitive psychology experimental paradigms, electrophysiological brain network construction methods, deep learning techniques, and interpretability technologies, a novel approach to cognitive state research is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that this method excels in identifying brain cognitive states across different scenarios, offering valuable insights into brain cognitive function research and personalized interventions for cognitive impairments.
